# Machine-Learning-Projects
A collection of projects and experiments exploring various machine learning algorithms and techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and model evaluation. Implemented using Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and other popular libraries.


This repository contains a curated set of machine learning projects developed as part of academic coursework, research, and independent study. Projects cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Classification and Regression
- Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Real-world datasets (e.g., UCI, Kaggle)

Each project is organized in its folder with code, datasets (or links), and documentation.

## Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Jupyter Notebooks
